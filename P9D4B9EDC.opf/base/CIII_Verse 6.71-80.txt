It’s similar to cataract-inflicted eyesWhen spirits see a river’s water being pus.In short,
please understand that, just as what you knowHas no existence, neither does the mind itself.
(6.71)

And if detached from subject-object there could beDependent nature, empty of duality,Then who
would know of its existence? Just to say,‘It’s there but not perceived,’ is quite unreasonable.
(6.72)

It isn’t proven to experience itself.And if you say a later memory is proof,You’re giving something
that is unproven as proof;And what’s not proven cannot function as a proof. (6.73)

But let’s assume that self-awareness is affirmed.That memory remembers it is still unsound,Because
it’s other, like an unknown in one’s mind.This argument will conquer any counterclaim.
(6.74)

For us, the one who has the memory is notDistinct from he who had experience of something.To
think, ‘I saw,’ is therefore memory to us,As is the way conventional worldly people think.
(6.75)

And so, as self-awareness cannot be the case,What is perceiving your dependent nature then?The
actor, act and object cannot be the same,And thus to apprehend itself makes little sense.
(6.76)

If, even though it is by nature unproducedAnd isn’t known, dependent nature can exist,How has
the barren woman’s son offended themThat he should suffer this denial of being real? (6.77)

When this dependent nature can’t exist at all,Then how can it be causing relative events?When
so obsessed with substance, our opponents willJust gainsay every normal worldly principle.
(6.78)

There is no other method that will lead to peaceApart from noble master Nāgārjuna’s way.But
they stray from the truths, the real and relative –One gains not liberation when ignoring
these. (6.79)

Conventional truth works as a means to reach an end.The ultimate is like the end one tries to
reach.But those who do not see how these should be discernedAre led by faulty fancies down
mistaken paths. (6.80)
