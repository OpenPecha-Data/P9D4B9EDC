And so, since things do not arise uncaused,Are not the work of an almighty god,Nor are produced
from self, other, or both,They are interdependently brought forth. (6.114)

And as all things arise interdependentlyThese theories will not withstand analysis.Submitted
to interdependence’s argumentsAll complex nets of faulty views are ripped to shreds. (6.115)

Such theories are relevant if things exist,But now it has been shown how things cannot exist.Without
existents such ideas can’t be maintained,Just like a fire won’t keep burning without
fuel. (6.116)

While ordinary men are trapped by theories,By not pursuing concepts yogis are set free.The wise
have said that it’s analysis which willAlleviate one of conceptual ideas. (6.117)

He did not for the love of quarrelling presentThe treatise’s explorations, but to liberate.One
can’t be blamed if one’s opponents’ theoriesAre shattered when unravelling reality. (6.118)

To be too fond of one’s own view, and hostile toThe views of others, this is still conceptual.But
when desire and aversion are dispelled,Analysis will bring one swift deliverance. (6.119)
