Were eye-mentation separate from what’s making it,Like co-occurring eyes, perceptions and so
forth,What purpose would production serve for what exists?The problems faced if it does not
have been explained. (6.20)

If separate things are made by a productive cause,Do they exist or not? Both? Neither of these
two?Why need producing if they do? What’s done if not?What’s done if both? What’s done
if neither of the two? (6.21)

‘What is the point of all these reasoned argumentsWhen it’s the normal view the world gives
credence to.The world indeed agrees things come from other things,Which means other-production
– what is there to prove?’ (6.22)
