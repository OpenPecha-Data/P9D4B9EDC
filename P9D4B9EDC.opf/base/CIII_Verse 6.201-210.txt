All such phenomena are void,Are empty of any such things.‘What can appear,’ such marks aren’t
real:The voidness of defining marks. (6.201)

A form is ‘that which can appear.’A feeling is ‘experience.’Perception is ‘to grasp at marks.’Formations
are ‘created things.’ (6.202)

‘To recognise specific things’Is what defines our consciousness.The skandhas’ mark is suffering,The
dhātus are a deadly snake. (6.203)

The sense fields, so the Buddha said,Facilitate development.Things that arise dependentlyAre
marked by a collectiveness. (6.204)

To give marks generosity,While painlessness is discipline.To not be vexed is tolerance,And flawlessness
is diligence. (6.205)

Absorption is collectedness.Not clinging marks intelligence.And so the six perfections areDescribed
by their defining marks. (6.206)

The dhyānas, the immeasurables,As well as all the formless realms,Were taught by he who knew
them wellTo be unagitated states. (6.207)

The thirty-seven factors ofAwakening can ‘bring one forth.’The character of emptinessIs absence
of a reference point. (6.208)

The featureless is peacefulness.The third: no pain or ignorance.The liberations are definedAs
that by which one is set free. (6.209)

The powers are described as whatDelivers utter certainty.The Buddha’s confidences areIn essence
firm security. (6.210)
