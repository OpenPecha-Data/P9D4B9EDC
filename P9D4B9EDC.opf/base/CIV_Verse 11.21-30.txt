And how the bodhisattvas gathered did appear;How was their Dharma, and what standing they did
have,The way they studied, and the training they endured,And what amounts were given them
in offering. (11.21)

And likewise all their prior discipline,Their patience, effort, concentration andIntelligence,
all of these practicesThey clearly show within a single pore. (11.22)

The buddhas of the past and those to come,Those present now as far as space pervades,How in
the world they teach the Dharma’s tunesRelieving beings seized by suffering; (11.23)

And all their works from making the resolveTill wakening; these things they clearly knowAnd
demonstrate within a single pore,And instantly, as if they were their own. (11.24)

So too with every deed done throughout timeBy bodhisattvas, solitary ones,The noble hearers
and all common folk,They show at once and in a single pore. (11.25)

Through will power these pure ones can display the worldsAs far as space extends within a speck
of dust,The speck engulfing the entire universeWithout growth of the speck nor shrinking
of the worlds. (11.26)

With no conceptual thought you can displayIn every instant till the end of timeDiverse activities
as countless asAll specks of dust on every continent. (11.27)

The might of knowing what is fact and what is not,And likewise what will be the consequence
of acts,To understand the different preferences of beingsAnd what their various abilities
might be; (11.28)

To know whose faculties are good and whose are not,Where every path with lead; the might of
knowing allSamādhis (concentrations), liberated states,Absorptions, states of equilibrium
and such; (11.29)

To have the power to recount all previous lives,To know the processes of death and then rebirth,To
know that all defilements have been fully spent;This is a summary of all the powers
ten. (11.30)
