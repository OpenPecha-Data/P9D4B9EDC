This ground is where the victor heirs now entertainAbsorptions and the supernormal sense powers.Attachment,
anger – these have been completely spent.They’re able to subdue mundane desirous
love. (3.11)

The Sugata would chiefly recommend these three,Of giving and so forth, to lay practitioners.And
as they are the merit-type of gathering,They bring about the buddha in corporeal form.
(3.12)

On Luminous, where bodhisattvas stay like suns,The murkiness within themselves has been dispelled.They
now intend to shed all beings of their gloom.But though intense upon this ground,
no anger stirs. (3.13)

Thus is the third resolve from Entering the Middle Way.

The Fourth Ground: Radiant

Good qualities come in the wake of diligence;What brings one stores of merit and intelligence.As
this is where their diligence is burning strong,This ground, the fourth among them, is
the Radiant. (4.1)

There now appears for the sugata heirs a lightMore bright than copper, born from cultivation
ofThe thirty-seven factors of enlightenment –

And any sense of self is now entirely gone. (4.2)

Thus is the fourth resolve from Entering the Middle Way.

The Fifth Ground: Hard to Conquer

Great beings on this ground so Hard to OvercomeCannot be conquered even by the demon hordes.

With excellent absorption these high-minded onesAre masters in the subtle nature of the truths.
(5.1)

Thus is the fifth resolve from Entering the Middle Way.

The Sixth Ground: Present
