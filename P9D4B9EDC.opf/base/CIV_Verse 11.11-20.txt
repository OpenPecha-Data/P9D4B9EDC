Just as there is no difference in the space within the different jars,No difference is there
in existent things in true reality.Thus, when you came to realise that things are of a single
taste,O wise one, in a single instant you knew all which can be known. (11.11)

‘If true reality is peace, the mind cannot engage with it.If mind cannot engage it, then the
knowing subject makes no sense.Without a knowing it’s absurd for something to be known at
all.And who is that non-knower teaching others, “This is how it is”?’ (11.12)

Reality is unborn, and the mind as well is free from birth.Thus, when relating to this it’s
as if it knows reality.For just as it is when the mind takes on the aspects of somethingThat
it can know the object, this makes sense from the conventional stance. (11.13)

Through their enjoyment bodies, brought by merit’s force,And through their powers – emanations,
space and more –The Dharma’s sounds of true reality emerge,And so reality is known within
the world. (11.14)

As when a master potter plies his wheelAnd labours long to get it spinning well,The wheel will
then keep turning without toilAnd pots and other things can be produced. (11.15)

It is the same for dharmakāya lordsWho make no effort at the present time,Yet truly marvellous
things do happen inResponse to beings’ merit and great aims. (11.16)

When all the brittle twigs of what is knownAre burned, peace comes – the Victor’s dharma form.And
then there is no birth and no decay,The mind will cease, the kāya manifest. (11.17)

The peaceful kāya, lucid like the bounteous tree,Without conceptual thought just like the wishing-jewel,Grants
lasting riches on the world till all are free,Appearing just to those free
from complexity. (11.18)

The mighty sages can within a single formAnd in a single instant demonstrate all pastExistences
relating to them, though they’re gone,Complete, in detail, and with flawless clarity.
(11.19)

They demonstrate completely in a single formHow buddha realms and mighty sages did appear;And
how their forms, acts, strengths and powers were;The size and manner of the groups of hearers
there, (11.20)
