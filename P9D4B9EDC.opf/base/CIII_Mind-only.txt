When bodhisattvas dwell within intelligenceThey know reality to be just consciousness;No subject
can be seen without the object, thusThey find the triple realm to be the mind alone.
(6.45)

It is just like the waves that will appearUpon the ocean as by wind it’s stirred,When from the
substrate, seed of all, appearsJust consciousness by self-potential spurred. (6.46)

And this dependent nature is the sourceFrom whence ideas of real things then appear –Appears
without external things, exists,In nature free from all abstracting thought. (6.47)

But how can mind be there without external things?‘It’s like a dream,’ you say. Well, let’s
consider that:For me, in dreams as well my mind does not exist,Which means that your example
is not relevant. (6.48)

If mind exists since dreams can be recalledWhen waking, then external things should too,Since
just as you recall the thought ‘I saw,’You do remember these external things. (6.49)

You claim, ‘It’s not there when one is asleep, becauseThere is no visual consciousness, just
conscious mind,Its images believed to be external things.And as in dreams, the same is taking
place right now.’ (6.50)
