A barren woman’s son cannot in fact be bornBy worldly standards or in true reality.It is the
same with anything, they don’t occurAs true things in reality nor in the world. (6.111)

The Teacher thus proclaimed that all phenomenaAre peace from the beginning, free from any birth,Complete
transcendence of a nature that is real,Which means that there is never any birth
of things. (6.112)

Though pots and such aren’t there in true reality,The world’s consensus is that they in fact
exist.For all phenomena this is the case, which meansIt doesn’t follow they’re like barren
women’s sons. (6.113)

And so, since things do not arise uncaused,Are not the work of an almighty god,Nor are produced
from self, other, or both,They are interdependently brought forth. (6.114)

And as all things arise interdependentlyThese theories will not withstand analysis.Submitted
to interdependence’s argumentsAll complex nets of faulty views are ripped to shreds. (6.115)

Such theories are relevant if things exist,But now it has been shown how things cannot exist.Without
existents such ideas can’t be maintained,Just like a fire won’t keep burning without
fuel. (6.116)

While ordinary men are trapped by theories,By not pursuing concepts yogis are set free.The wise
have said that it’s analysis which willAlleviate one of conceptual ideas. (6.117)

He did not for the love of quarrelling presentThe treatise’s explorations, but to liberate.One
can’t be blamed if one’s opponents’ theoriesAre shattered when unravelling reality. (6.118)

To be too fond of one’s own view, and hostile toThe views of others, this is still conceptual.But
when desire and aversion are dispelled,Analysis will bring one swift deliverance. (6.119)

They see how all afflictions and all faultsCome from the the view of an identity.And realising
its object as the self,The yogi goes on to refute this self. (6.120)
