...Well that will be a feat to prove:Inseparable continua make little sense. (6.60)What makes
for Upagupta’s and Maitreya’s traitsAre different, and not part of one continuum.And when
distinct things keep their separate character,It’s nonsense to believe they’re one continuum.
(6.61)

‘Promoted by its own potential there appearsA ceaseless rising of the visual consciousness,And
this potential which supports its consciousnessIs taken as the physical eye faculty.’ (6.62)

‘But people cannot see that without outer formsThese sense-produced cognitions clearly manifestAs
blue and such, originating from their seeds,Instead they take the mind to be external
things.’ (6.63)

‘The images in dreams are not external thingsBut mind that is assuming shapes resulting fromPotentials
present. When awake it is the same:There’s nothing on the outside, just the thinking
mind.’ (6.64)

If in the dream such blueness may present itselfTo mind even without the function of the eyes,Then
why do these things not appear now to the blindFrom seeds that ripen though they cannot
use their eyes? (6.65)

And if you say it is when sleeping that the sixth’sPotential ripens, and not while one is awake,Then
why not say that just as now it isn’t ripe,The sixth’s potential neither ripens in
the dream? (6.66)

For just as lack of eyesight cannot be its cause,When dreaming it is not the sleep that is the
cause.We therefore grant that there are things as well as eyesThat cause our false perceptions
seen when in a dream. (6.67)

It seems that every counterargument they haveIs nothing more than repetition of their claim.Their
case is thus rejected – nowhere will one findThe Buddha stating that there are existent
things. (6.68)

When yogis train according to their guru’s wordsAnd see that skeletons are covering the earth,The
three are still considered unproduced, becauseIt’s guidance utilising false mind images.
(6.69)

And if you think that these repulsive imagesAre just like any object that the mind conceives,When
other people turn their minds towards such thingsThey should discern them, and these
wouldn’t then be false. (6.70)
