Since worldly standards are not valid all the way,The world cannot disprove what is reality.But
worldly objects are agreed on in the world,So they’ll disprove you if you do reject these
things. (6.31)

A worldly person may just sow a seedBut later say, ‘I have produced this child,’Or else believe
that he, ‘did plant this tree.’No other-rising hence within the world. (6.32)

Because the sprout and seed are not distinct,Seeds haven’t been destroyed when sprouts are there.And
since they neither are the very same,We wouldn’t say the seeds exist with sprouts.
(6.33)

If things existed with their own identity,Rejecting this would mean the ruin of these things,And
emptiness would be destroying entities.This makes no sense, and therefore things do not
exist. (6.34)

When analysed there’s nothing that remains of thingsExcept the very nature of reality.And thus
the things which are conventions of the worldAre not to be subjected to analysis. (6.35)

No reasoning permits production from itselfOr other at the level of reality.It can’t be justified
even conventionally.So then, by what can your production be sustained? (6.36)

Such empty objects as reflections and the likeAre not unheard of when conditions do convene.And
just as from reflections and such empty thingsCognitions with their aspects are indeed
produced, (6.37)It is the same with every empty entity,As from these very empty things, things
do emerge.

And since true character exists in neither truth,There’s nothing that’s eternal or that terminates.
(6.38)

Because it doesn’t really cease to be,Though there’s no substrate, still the potencyOf karma
stays long after it has ceased,And will produce effects – this you should know. (6.39)

The foolish man who has a pleasant dreamIs still desirous when waking up.And likewise, though
the karmic act has ceasedAnd lacks reality, it has results. (6.40)
