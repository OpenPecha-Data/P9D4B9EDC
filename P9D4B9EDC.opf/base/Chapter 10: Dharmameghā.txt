The Tenth Ground: Cloud of Dharma

Upon them on the tenth ground every buddha now bestows supremeEmpowerment, and through their
wisdom they now reach supremacy.Then from these victor’s heirs spontaneous rains of Dharma
shower down,Like torrents from the clouds, so beings’ crops of virtue may increase. (10.1)

Thus is the tenth resolve from Entering the Middle Way.
