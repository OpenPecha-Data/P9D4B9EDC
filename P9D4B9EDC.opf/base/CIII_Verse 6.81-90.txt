The claims concerning the dependent you have made,I wouldn’t venture even for the relative.Although
they don’t exist, pragmatically I sayThey do, in order to comply with worldly view.
(6.81)

For arhats, who have left behind the aggregatesAnd dwell in peace, these things do not indeed
exist.If that was true for those who dwell within the world,I wouldn’t say that from the
worldly view they do. (6.82)

But if you think that they will be no match for you,Then go ahead and contradict the worldly
view.So let the battle of the world and you commence,And after I shall follow who’s more
powerful. (6.83)

In Present’s presence bodhisattvas realiseThe three realms to be nothing more than consciousness,And
seeing that eternal makers are disproved,They understand the maker to be mind alone.

And hence to fuel the insight of the clever ones,Make clear the meaning, the Omniscient One

Awakened indicates awakened to the truth.And likewise when the sutras speak of only mindIt means

If mind alone in fact was meant to indicateDenial of the physical reality,Then why indeed was
mind too by the Mighty OneDescribed to be from karma and confusion born? (6.88)

It truly is the mind that makes the spectacleThat is the worlds of beings and environments.It’s
stated that all beings’ states are karma-born –Dispense with mind and there will be karma
no more. (6.89)

Though matter is a fact, it can’t claim to possessThe same creative power that the mind displays.A
maker other than the mind is thus denied,But that is not to say that matter is disproved.
