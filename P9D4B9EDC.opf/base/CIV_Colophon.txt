This completes Entering the Middle Way, elucidating the profound and the vast, composed by the
master Candrakīrti, an upholder of the supreme vehicle who possessed invincible wisdom
and compassion, and who by milking the painted cow defeated clinging to true existence.This
was translated from a Kashmiri manuscript by the Indian preceptor Tilaka Kalaśa and the
translator Patsab Nyimadrak in the Ratnagupta temple in the Kashmiri city Anupama (Shrinagar)
during the reign of the Kashmiri king Śrī Āryadeva. It was subsequently edited and finalised
based on a manuscript from the eastern country of Aparānta by the Indian preceptor
Kanakavarman and the same Tibetan translator in the Ramoche temple in Lhasa (Rasa).The author’s
and the translators’ colophons have here been brought into harmony with those of the
commentary, and the differences there might have been between the root text and the commentary
have been amended.
