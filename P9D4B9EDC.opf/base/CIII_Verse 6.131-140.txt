For you the yogi seeing selflessness would notThen realise the reality of form and such.Not
having seen its nature, when perceiving formThey’re caught by it, creating passion and so
forth. (6.131)

That aggregates are self, you base this claim uponThe Teacher’s statement that, ‘The aggregates
are self.’But this refutes a self distinct from aggregates,As other sutras state that
form is not the self. (6.132)

That neither form nor feeling constitute the self,Nor do perception, formations, or consciousness,Has
been proclaimed in various other sutra quotes.In brief, that aggregates are self
is not affirmed. (6.133)

When saying it’s the aggregates that are the self,It’s their collection, not the aggregates
themselves.But this does not exist, and so it cannot be –Can’t be protector, cannot tame,
nor serve as judge. (6.134)

A chariot would be the presence of its parts.As with a chariot, the same goes for the self.‘Contingent
on the aggregates,’ the sutra states.The self is thus not just the aggregates combined.
(6.135)

‘It is the shape,’ you say, but shape belongs to form.So though you say it’s these that constitute
the self,The mental groups cannot then be what this self isDue to the fact that these
cannot assume a shape. (6.136)

It makes no sense that grasped and grasper are the same,Since act and actor then would be identical.‘There
is no actor, just the act,’ you might then think.But no, since without actor
there can be no act. (6.137)

The Sage states that the self is recognisedWith reference to earth, water, fire, wind,To consciousness
and space – six elements –And six supports of contact, such as eyes; (6.138)

And is assumed from mind and mental states.And it is therefore these though not the same,Nor
just the mere collection they make up.One cannot find the sense of self in these. (6.139)

That seeing selflessness would shed the lasting selfWhile not believing it to be ego’s support,I
find it quite astounding then to hear you sayThat knowing selflessness uproots the view
of self. (6.140)
