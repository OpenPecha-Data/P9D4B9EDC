Illustrious One, you have compassion for this world that garners painAnd evil when unwisely
thinking entities are real or not;They’re born and pass away, they lose the pleasant, find
unpleasant things –Through love for them you spurn your peace, ignore your own transcendent
state. (11.51)

The bhikshu Chandrakirti’s wayIs based upon the Treatise onThe Middle Way, conforming toThe
scriptures and direct advice. (11.52)

Just as no other source presentsThis dharma in this accurate way,The wise should recognise that
whatIs found herein is quite unique. (11.53)

Some, frightened by the oceanic tinge of Nagarjuna’s mind,Have kept their distance to this wonderful
tradition; but right nowThe dew that makes his verses open like a waterlily’s budsHave
settled, and the hopes of Chandrakirti, Famous Moon, are met. (11.54)

The scary depths of this reality presented here, is only graspedBy those with some experience
– though learned, others will not comprehend.Thus seeing them as self-devised traditions
– those who claim there is a self,Or any other groups – place not your trust in any other
school but this. (11.55)

May all the merit gathered from explaining Nāgārjuna’s way fill all of space,Their intellects,
a sky obscured by the afflictions, be lit up by autumn stars,And as they catch the jewel
from the cobra’s head, their minds, may the entire worldThus come to understand reality
and swiftly travel to sugatahood. (11.56)

This completes Entering the Middle Way, elucidating the profound and the vast, composed by the
master Candrakīrti, an upholder of the supreme vehicle who possessed invincible wisdom
and compassion, and who by milking the painted cow defeated clinging to true existence.This
was translated from a Kashmiri manuscript by the Indian preceptor Tilaka Kalaśa and the
translator Patsab Nyimadrak in the Ratnagupta temple in the Kashmiri city Anupama (Shrinagar)
during the reign of the Kashmiri king Śrī Āryadeva. It was subsequently edited and finalised
based on a manuscript from the eastern country of Aparānta by the Indian preceptor
Kanakavarman and the same Tibetan translator in the Ramoche temple in Lhasa (Rasa).The author’s
and the translators’ colophons have here been brought into harmony with those of the
commentary, and the differences there might have been between the root text and the commentary
have been amended.
