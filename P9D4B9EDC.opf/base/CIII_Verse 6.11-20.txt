And if, for you, the seed and sprout are indistinct,The so-called sprout should like the seed
not be observed.Or, since they are the very same, just as the sproutThey both should then
be seen – thus do not make such claims. (6.11)

It’s when the cause has ceased that its result is seen,And thus that they’re the same is not
the worldly view.

So, neither in reality nor in the worldIs this imagined self-production reasonable. (6.12)

If one accepts self-rising, maker and the made,As well as act and actor, these would be the
same.They’re not, so self-arising I cannot accept –The faults entailed have been elaborately
explained. (6.13)

If something different could give rise to something else,Then utter darkness should emerge from
tongues of flame.And anything could be produced from everything,Since in their difference
all non-makers are the same. (6.14)

‘What has potential to be made defines result.What can produce it is the cause, though something
else.In one continuum, from makers, things arise,And rice sprouts won’t therefore produce
barley and such.’ (6.15)

Take species such as barley, ironwood or dhak:These can’t produce a rice-sprout, lack that potency,Don’t
share continuum, lack similarity.With otherness, a rice seed too lacks in these
ways. (6.16)

The sprout is never there the same time as the seed,So how can seed be other without otherness?Thus
since one cannot prove that seeds give rise to sprouts,Give up this view that things
arise from something else. (6.17)

‘As when you see the levers of a balance scaleAscending and descending simultaneously;Just so
producers cease as what’s produced appears.’

If coinciding, yes – they don’t, so this can’t be. (6.18)

While made it faces its production, isn’t yet.While ceasing it still is, but tends towards its
end.So how can this be similar to a balance scale?

Arising with no subject doesn’t make much sense. (6.19)
