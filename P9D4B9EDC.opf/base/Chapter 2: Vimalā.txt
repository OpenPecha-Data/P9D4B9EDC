The Second Ground: Immaculate

Provided with pure traits of perfect disciplineThey shun misconduct’s blemish even when they
dream,

And cultivate the tenfold path of righteous actsWith ways immaculate in body, speech and mind.
(2.1)

And it is in this tenfold virtuous pathThey now excel, becoming purer still.Forever stainless,
like the autumn moon,It beautifies them with a peaceful glow. (2.2)

Believing discipline to be by nature pureWill in itself deprive it of its purity.And thus they
never harbour any concepts whichConsider a distinction in the threefold sphere. (2.3)

Although a person’s moral footing is corrupt,To give grants affluence though in the lower realms.But
when the funds and profits have been fully spent,One can’t expect that there will
be a future yield. (2.4)

If one is free and in an advantageous stateBut makes no further effort to remain therein,When
falling into the abyss, all free will lost,How will one manage to escape these states again?
(2.5)

And thus, as soon as generosity was taught,The Victor then went on to speak of discipline.If
in the field of discipline one’s qualitiesCan flourish, yields can be perpetually enjoyed.
(2.6)

For ordinary beings, those born from his words,Those who will self-awaken and the conqueror’s
heirs,It’s discipline and nothing else that is the causeThat brings about true excellence
and higher states. (2.7)

Like corpse and sea will not remain in company,Like luck and mishap are not seen to coexist,The
eminent who are upholding disciplineWill not with those of wayward conduct wish to mix.
(2.8)

When keeping discipline with notions of the three –Abstention with an agent, object and an act
–It’s said to be perfection that is just mundane.It’s supramundane when not entertaining
these. (2.9)

The moon-born victor’s heir – the glory of this worldWhile yet transcending it – completely
free from stain;Immaculate, just like a soothing autumn moonDispelling all the agonies in
beings’ minds. (2.10)

Thus is the second resolve from Entering the Middle Way.
