It is the worldly fact that aggregates are fiveWhile one is placed within the world’s reality.But
when the wisdom of reality they seekHas dawned, for yogis these will no longer appear.
(6.91)

If form is absent don’t assume the mind is real.And don’t insist that form is there without
the mind.The Buddha would reject them equally withinThe wisdom texts – in abhidharma both
were taught. (6.92)

Dismiss the tiered system of the dual truth,Your substance is then barred and cannot be maintained.Acknowledge
thus that there are levels to the truth:Birth in the world but never in
reality. (6.93)

The sutras where it states that what we see is notExternal, but the mind perceived in various
ways,That was provisional, taught to invalidateThe physical for those who are attached to
form. (6.94)

The Teacher did express it as provisional.Provisionality is shown by reasoning.This scripture
makes it clear that other sutras tooOf similar sort will likewise be the leading truth.
(6.95)

The buddhas taught that when there is no object knownThe knowing of it will be easy to refute.The
known is therefore what’s initially denied,Because without the known the knowing is
disproved. (6.96)

And thus you should discern the level of the text:When what is being explained is not realityBut
leads one, then the sutra is provisional;It is definitive if voidness is the theme. (6.97)

That things arise from both will not be reasonable,Because one will encounter faults explained
above.Not in the world nor actually can this be claimedWhen by each one production cannot
be sustained. (6.98)

If causelessly production could in fact take place,Then endless things would always come from
everything.And people of the world would not in all these waysBe planting seeds and so forth
to make crops appear. (6.99)

If living were devoid of causes one would notPerceive more than the sky-lotus’s scent and hue.But
since the dazzling beauty of the world is seen,Just like one’s mind the world arises
causally. (6.100)
