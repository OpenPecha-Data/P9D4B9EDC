A fire burning with the fuel of objects knownProduces light; this third ground thus receives
its name,The Luminous, as here for the sugatas’ heirA copper-glow appears which is just like
the sun. (3.1)

If out of baseless fury someone were to comeAnd sever from their body all their flesh and bone,To
torture them, cut piece by piece and take their time,Towards their butcher tolerance
will only grow. (3.2)

When bodhisattvas see that there exists no self,What’s cut, the cutter, time of cutting and
the mode,Phenomena like these appear reflection-like,An insight through which they are able
to forbear. (3.3)

If you resent the one who’s caused you injury,Does your resentment take away the harm that’s
done?To bear a grudge will serve no purpose here and now,And also brings adversity in lives
to come. (3.4)

The karmic outcome of non-virtue in the pastIs held to be the thing that brings it to an end.So
why then keep on sowing seeds of sufferingBy angrily inflicting harm upon your foe? (3.5)

One’s anger for the victor’s heirs will instantlyDestroy the virtue gained from generosityAnd
discipline throughout a hundred aeons; thusNo evil is there quite like one’s intolerance.
(3.6)

It fouls one’s features, steers one to unholy ones.Deprives one of the means to tell what’s
right from wrong.Intolerance will send one straight to lower states.

The qualities of patience are their opposites. (3.7)Forbearance makes one beautiful, it grants
esteemAmong the holy, makes one morally adept;In future lives one will be human or divine,And
every negativity will disappear. (3.8)

The common beings and the victor heirs who seeThe faults of enmity and patience’s qualities,Should
shun intolerance and always try to haveForbearance, something that is praised by noble
ones. (3.9)

Though dedicated for complete awakening,It’s still mundane if the three reference points remain.When
free from these three references, the Buddha taughtThe same to be perfection that
transcends the world. (3.10)
