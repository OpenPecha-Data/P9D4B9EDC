The bhikshu Chandrakirti’s wayIs based upon the Treatise onThe Middle Way, conforming toThe
scriptures and direct advice. (11.52)

Just as no other source presentsThis dharma in this accurate way,The wise should recognise that
whatIs found herein is quite unique. (11.53)

Some, frightened by the oceanic tinge of Nagarjuna’s mind,Have kept their distance to this wonderful
tradition; but right nowThe dew that makes his verses open like a waterlily’s budsHave
settled, and the hopes of Chandrakirti, Famous Moon, are met. (11.54)

The scary depths of this reality presented here, is only graspedBy those with some experience
– though learned, others will not comprehend.Thus seeing them as self-devised traditions
– those who claim there is a self,Or any other groups – place not your trust in any other
school but this. (11.55)

May all the merit gathered from explaining Nāgārjuna’s way fill all of space,Their intellects,
a sky obscured by the afflictions, be lit up by autumn stars,And as they catch the jewel
from the cobra’s head, their minds, may the entire worldThus come to understand reality
and swiftly travel to sugatahood. (11.56)
