Thus brightened by the rays of clear intelligenceThey see the triple world as unborn from the
startAs clear as a myrobalan plum in their palm –Cessation is achieved through truth that’s
relative. (6.224)

Although remaining in cessation all the time,Compassion for defenceless ones will still occur.From
this point onwards their intelligence defeatsHalf-buddhas and those born from the Sugata’s
speech. (6.225)

They soar ahead of beings, like the king of swans,On white and outstretched wings of truth,
the relativeAnd ultimate, and speed ahead on virtue’s windAcross the ocean of the Victor’s
qualities. (6.226)

Thus is the sixth resolve from Entering the Middle Way.

The Seventh Ground: Far Progressed

On Far Progressed the bodhisattvas can engageCessation in each moment, and they now attainA
brilliant perfection in their skilful means. (7.1)

Thus is the seventh resolve from Entering the Middle Way.

The Eight Ground: Immovable

To reach yet even greater virtue than beforeThese mighty beings enter the ImmovableWhere they
acquire irreversibility.Their aspirations being fully pure, they areNow roused from their
cessation by victorious ones. (8.1)

No blemish will maintain its hold upon the non-desirous mind,And so, upon the eight ground stains
are severed, utter peace attained.Afflictions at an end, they now surpass the triple
realm, and stillThe space-like boundless wealth of all the buddhas lies beyond their reach.
(8.2)

Although samsara has been stopped, they have attained the powers ten,And through these, manifest
in various ways to beings of the world. (8.3)

Thus is the eighth resolve from Entering the Middle Way.

The Ninth Ground: Perfect Intellect

Upon the ninth their power is complete and pure in every way,And likewise fully pure their qualities
of perfect intellect. (9.1)

Thus is the ninth resolve from Entering the Middle Way.

The Tenth Ground: Cloud of Dharma

Upon them on the tenth ground every buddha now bestows supremeEmpowerment, and through their
wisdom they now reach supremacy.Then from these victor’s heirs spontaneous rains of Dharma
shower down,Like torrents from the clouds, so beings’ crops of virtue may increase. (10.1)

Thus is the tenth resolve from Entering the Middle Way.

The Ground of Buddhahood
