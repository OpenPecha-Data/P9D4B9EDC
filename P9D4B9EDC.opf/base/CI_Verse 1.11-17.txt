And even for the inconsiderate,The crude whose sole pursuit is their own ends,It’s giving which
provides desired wealthAnd brings about relief from suffering. (1.11)

It’s when one trains in generosityThat one can swiftly meet with noble ones,Thus end the sequence
of existencesAnd reach the goal, the final state of peace. (1.12)

For those committed to the benefit of all,The joy that giving grants will not be long delayed.So
both for tender-hearted and the callous onesAdvice on generosity is cardinal. (1.13)

The joy the buddha heirs experience as theyAre asked ‘Please give!’ and merely contemplate these
words,Won’t even favour sages when they enter peace.No need to mention then the act of
giving all! (1.14)

Their own experience when cutting off their fleshTo offer it to others makes them recogniseHow
those in hell and elsewhere suffer agony;They set about to swiftly bring this to an end.
(1.15)

To give without a giver, gift, recipient,Now this is a perfection that transcends the world.

As long as there is still attachment to these three,We call it a perfection that remains mundane.
(1.16)

A joy now settles in the bodhisattva’s mindAnd gives this fine support a splendid radiance,A
joy just like the moonstone which can banish allOppressive darkness, making them victorious.
(1.17)

Thus is the first resolve from Entering the Middle Way.

The Second Ground: Immaculate

Provided with pure traits of perfect disciplineThey shun misconduct’s blemish even when they
dream,

And cultivate the tenfold path of righteous actsWith ways immaculate in body, speech and mind.
(2.1)

And it is in this tenfold virtuous pathThey now excel, becoming purer still.Forever stainless,
like the autumn moon,It beautifies them with a peaceful glow. (2.2)

Believing discipline to be by nature pureWill in itself deprive it of its purity.And thus they
never harbour any concepts whichConsider a distinction in the threefold sphere. (2.3)

Although a person’s moral footing is corrupt,To give grants affluence though in the lower realms.But
when the funds and profits have been fully spent,One can’t expect that there will
be a future yield. (2.4)

If one is free and in an advantageous stateBut makes no further effort to remain therein,When
falling into the abyss, all free will lost,How will one manage to escape these states again?
(2.5)

And thus, as soon as generosity was taught,The Victor then went on to speak of discipline.If
in the field of discipline one’s qualitiesCan flourish, yields can be perpetually enjoyed.
(2.6)

For ordinary beings, those born from his words,Those who will self-awaken and the conqueror’s
heirs,It’s discipline and nothing else that is the causeThat brings about true excellence
and higher states. (2.7)

Like corpse and sea will not remain in company,Like luck and mishap are not seen to coexist,The
eminent who are upholding disciplineWill not with those of wayward conduct wish to mix.
(2.8)

When keeping discipline with notions of the three –Abstention with an agent, object and an act
–It’s said to be perfection that is just mundane.It’s supramundane when not entertaining
these. (2.9)

The moon-born victor’s heir – the glory of this worldWhile yet transcending it – completely
free from stain;Immaculate, just like a soothing autumn moonDispelling all the agonies in
beings’ minds. (2.10)

Thus is the second resolve from Entering the Middle Way.

The Third Ground: Luminous

A fire burning with the fuel of objects knownProduces light; this third ground thus receives
its name,The Luminous, as here for the sugatas’ heirA copper-glow appears which is just like
the sun. (3.1)

If out of baseless fury someone were to comeAnd sever from their body all their flesh and bone,To
torture them, cut piece by piece and take their time,Towards their butcher tolerance
will only grow. (3.2)

When bodhisattvas see that there exists no self,What’s cut, the cutter, time of cutting and
the mode,Phenomena like these appear reflection-like,An insight through which they are able
to forbear. (3.3)

If you resent the one who’s caused you injury,Does your resentment take away the harm that’s
done?To bear a grudge will serve no purpose here and now,And also brings adversity in lives
to come. (3.4)

The karmic outcome of non-virtue in the pastIs held to be the thing that brings it to an end.So
why then keep on sowing seeds of sufferingBy angrily inflicting harm upon your foe? (3.5)

One’s anger for the victor’s heirs will instantlyDestroy the virtue gained from generosityAnd
discipline throughout a hundred aeons; thusNo evil is there quite like one’s intolerance.
(3.6)

It fouls one’s features, steers one to unholy ones.Deprives one of the means to tell what’s
right from wrong.Intolerance will send one straight to lower states.

The qualities of patience are their opposites. (3.7)Forbearance makes one beautiful, it grants
esteemAmong the holy, makes one morally adept;In future lives one will be human or divine,And
every negativity will disappear. (3.8)

The common beings and the victor heirs who seeThe faults of enmity and patience’s qualities,Should
shun intolerance and always try to haveForbearance, something that is praised by noble
ones. (3.9)

Though dedicated for complete awakening,It’s still mundane if the three reference points remain.When
free from these three references, the Buddha taughtThe same to be perfection that
transcends the world. (3.10)

This ground is where the victor heirs now entertainAbsorptions and the supernormal sense powers.Attachment,
anger – these have been completely spent.They’re able to subdue mundane desirous
love. (3.11)

The Sugata would chiefly recommend these three,Of giving and so forth, to lay practitioners.And
as they are the merit-type of gathering,They bring about the buddha in corporeal form.
(3.12)

On Luminous, where bodhisattvas stay like suns,The murkiness within themselves has been dispelled.They
now intend to shed all beings of their gloom.But though intense upon this ground,
no anger stirs. (3.13)

Thus is the third resolve from Entering the Middle Way.

The Fourth Ground: Radiant

Good qualities come in the wake of diligence;What brings one stores of merit and intelligence.As
this is where their diligence is burning strong,This ground, the fourth among them, is
the Radiant. (4.1)

There now appears for the sugata heirs a lightMore bright than copper, born from cultivation
ofThe thirty-seven factors of enlightenment –

And any sense of self is now entirely gone. (4.2)

Thus is the fourth resolve from Entering the Middle Way.

The Fifth Ground: Hard to Conquer

Great beings on this ground so Hard to OvercomeCannot be conquered even by the demon hordes.

With excellent absorption these high-minded onesAre masters in the subtle nature of the truths.
(5.1)

Thus is the fifth resolve from Entering the Middle Way.

The Sixth Ground: Present
