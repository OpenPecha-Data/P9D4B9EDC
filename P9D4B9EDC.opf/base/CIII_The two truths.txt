The things perceived may either be correct or false.As such all things convey a dual character.Correctly
seen, the object is reality;As taught, the truth is relative when falsely seen.
(6.23)

As faculties may function well or be at fault,One further reckons two types of the falsely seen.Compared
to knowledge stemming from sound faculties,What’s known through faulty faculties
is held as false. (6.24)

Perceptions of the world that happens whenSix faculties have not been compromisedAre true within
the world, the rest are allConsidered false according to the world. (6.25)

Ideas diverse misguided thinkers have made upWhen tossed around within the sleep of ignorance,And
notions from illusions, mirages and such,Not even worldly folk will think that these
are real. (6.26)

Perceptions of the ones impaired by eye diseaseCannot invalidate what’s known by healthy ones.Just
so, a mind which lacks the wisdom beyond taintCannot invalidate a flawless intellect.
(6.27)

It’s relative, delusion, when the real is masked.Regarding as the truth what is in fact contrivedIs
relative truth, this is what the sage expressed –And that which is contrived is simply
relative. (6.28)

That faulty image one presumes – those falling hairsWhich come when one is suffering from an
eye disease –Is seen for what it is by one with proper sight;At present we may thus deduce
reality. (6.29)

If worldly standards were correct the world would seeReality; what need for other noble ones?Would
there be reason to traverse the noble path?It’s senseless that the standards of a fool
are sound. (6.30)
