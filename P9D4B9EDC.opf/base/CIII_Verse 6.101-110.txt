If it’s the nature of the elements that makeYour mental image though its nature it does lack,How
could someone so densely dimmed towards this lifeBe trusted to have knowledge of the
lives beyond? (6.101)

When you deny that there are lives beyond this one,Your view of how things are is flawed since
such views haveThis bodily existence as their common ground,Like when you make the claim
that elements are real. (6.102)

It has been shown how elements cannot exist,As it was generally disproved things can’t ariseFrom
self, other, both, or without a cause; and soThough not explicit, they have no reality.
(6.103)

Because things don’t arise from self, other or both,Nor causelessly, they’re nothing in and
of themselves.The clouds of dense confusion lie across the world,And therefore objects are
perceived mistakenly. (6.104)

An eye disease may cause mistaken visions likeHairs, double moons, the peacock eyes, bees and
so forth.The unwise, tricked by their confusion, will likewiseBelieve the sundry fashioned
imagery they see. (6.105)

It is a sign of witlessness if one declares,‘Confusion causes karma; does not come without.’Just
like the sun of wisdom sheds the nightly gloom,The wise unravel emptiness and are set
free. (6.106)

‘If in reality things don’t in fact exist,They’re like a barren woman’s son and should like
himHave no existence also as conventional things.They must therefore exist as things inherently.’
(6.107)

Take objects such as hairs, although they are not there,Do still appear to someone who has cataracts.Thus,
first of all, please settle your dispute with them.And then go deal with those
impaired by ignorance. (6.108)

In fact you too see things that are not really there,The city of gandharvas, images in dreams,Illusions,
a mirage, reflections and so forth.So, is it not unsound how these appear to
you? (6.109)

Though actually these are as unborn asThe barren woman’s son, that does not meanThat these things
are not seen within the world.It’s therefore not conclusive what you say. (6.110)
