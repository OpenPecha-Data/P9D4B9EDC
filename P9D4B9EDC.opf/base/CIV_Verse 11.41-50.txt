its end.Disciples and the buddha heirs are likewise stoppedFrom voicing all the sky-like
buddha qualities. (11.41)

So how could someone such as me be able toPerceive and then convey these qualities of yours?But

Unwavering in form, and yet again you come into the world.You manifest descent and birth, and

To know the true reality, which is unchanging, has no types,Will be the only way that one can

Thus, like the adept who will conjure up a city to relieveThe travellers bound for the jewel

O Victor, how could you who were conceivedBy Lady Wisdom, by Compassion nursed,Pass into peace
whilst all the world has notBeen brought to peace, while space still has not ceased? (11.49)

into peace. (11.50)
