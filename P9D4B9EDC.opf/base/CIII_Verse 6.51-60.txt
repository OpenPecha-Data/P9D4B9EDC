Just like for you externals are not thereIn dreams, the mind as well is not produced.All three,
the eye, the object seen, the mindWhich they engender, each of these are false. (6.51)The
rest, with ears and such, are unproduced.

The same holds true awake as when you dreamSince all things are deceptive; there’s no mind,There
are no objects and no faculties. (6.52)

But just as one may see them when asleep,The three are still here now when we’re awake.And just
as when awake the three are gone,They’re gone when from delusion’s sleep we wake. (6.53)

The hairs an eye disease will make appear;The mind which the afflicted sense affects;His intellect
will see them both as real.With healthy sight they are both seen as false. (6.54)

If there could be cognition without something known,One would expect that healthy vision too
should knowThese hairs when gazing at the spot where hairs appear.This doesn’t happen, hence
this cannot be the case. (6.55)

‘There is no ripe potential for the healthy one,And therefore he does not have this experience;It’s
not because there’s nothing there that can be known.’But since potential is unreal
this doesn’t work. (6.56)

Potential for what has arisen cannot be,Nor can it be for what in fact is unproduced.With no
distinction one cannot distinguish it,Or else the barren woman’s son would be a fact. (6.57)

You may suggest that in the future it will be.But lacking in potential it cannot spring forth.And
mutual dependence used to prove something,The wise will say this fails to prove establishment.
(6.58)

If it comes from a ceased potential’s ripening,A separate potential then brings forth something.As
parts of a continuum must be distinct,One could have everything come from just anything.
(6.59)

‘The parts of a continuum are separate,But their continuum is an unbroken whole,Hence there’s
no fault.’ ...
