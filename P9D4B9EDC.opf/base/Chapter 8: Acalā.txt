The Eight Ground: Immovable

To reach yet even greater virtue than beforeThese mighty beings enter the ImmovableWhere they
acquire irreversibility.Their aspirations being fully pure, they areNow roused from their
cessation by victorious ones. (8.1)

No blemish will maintain its hold upon the non-desirous mind,And so, upon the eight ground stains
are severed, utter peace attained.Afflictions at an end, they now surpass the triple
realm, and stillThe space-like boundless wealth of all the buddhas lies beyond their reach.
(8.2)

Although samsara has been stopped, they have attained the powers ten,And through these, manifest
in various ways to beings of the world. (8.3)

Thus is the eighth resolve from Entering the Middle Way.
