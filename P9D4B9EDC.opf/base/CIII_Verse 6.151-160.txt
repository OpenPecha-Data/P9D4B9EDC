A chariot is not distinct from its own parts,Nor indistinct, and their possessor it is not,It
is not in its parts, they aren’t contained in it,It’s not the mere assembly, nor is it the
shape. (6.151)

If just the mere assembly were the chariot,The chariot would be there in the separate parts.Without
an owner of the parts they can’t be parts.The chariot as shape will neither make much
sense. (6.152)

You say the shape that each part had beforeIs present now within the chariot.Then just as when
it was in separate parts,It’s not there now when there’s a chariot. (6.153)

And if right now, when there’s a chariot here,The wheels and so forth have a different shape,Then
this should be perceived, but it is not.The chariot is thus not just the shape. (6.154)

For you, collections are not real at all,Its shape is thus not that of gathered parts.For how
could it assume a shape at all,Based on something that’s utterly unreal? (6.155)

But it is just as you yourself assert,That based upon a cause that is unrealArise results that
are themselves unreal.Please see that this is how all things occur. (6.156)

This shows it makes no sense that the ideaOf pot comes from these bases such as form.And being
unproduced these don’t exist,That they comprise a shape is hence unsound. (6.157)

These seven points leave it unjustifiedBoth in reality, and in the world.But left unanalysed
the world will stillIdentify it based upon its parts. (6.158)

It’s something that has parts, composed of separate bits.A chariot is held to be a functional
thing.For people it’s a grasper, and is true as such.Do not lay waste to what the world
agrees upon! (6.159)

The yogi asks, ‘These seven points show it’s unreal,So how can it exist?’ – and finds that it
does not.With this they easily access the truth of things.That it is real is still accepted
here and now. (6.160)
