‘Does your critique make contact with the criticised, or does it not?This may be asked, and
aren’t you then accountable to this same fault?’‘As what you say will only serve to quash
the view you hold yourself,Your criticism lacks the power to discredit what you aim.’ (6.171)

‘Because your cavilling is subject to the self-same consequenceAnd your denial of existent things
is quite unreasonable,Insightful persons will not be convinced by what you have to say.You
argue just to quarrel and have no position of your own.’ (6.172)

To claim that it’s an issue whether this critique makes contact withThe criticised or not while
criticising will only applyTo those thinking in absolutes, but we do not endorse a stance,And
therefore this unwanted consequence does not apply to us. (6.173)

As when the features of the sun being eclipsedAre also seen in its reflected silhouette,That
sun and likeness meet or not is ludicrous,It happens in dependence, just conventionally.
(6.174)

Although unreal, it helps us beautify our face.Just so, these arguments that have the power
toRefine the face of wisdom can’t be verified.And still, know that the proof they give is
realised. (6.175)

Yes, if the reason used as proof were something real,And real also the thing that we attempt
to prove,The argument of contact would be relevant.Since it’s not so you’re only troubling
yourself. (6.176)

That all things lack reality we show with ease.But it’s no easy matter for our challengerTo
demonstrate how things exist inherently.Why tax the world with webs of shoddy pedantry? (6.177)

If having grasped the prior points, now please forgetThis extra censure, that of touch, expressly
made.It wasn’t just for frivolous wrangling this was said,But so that such additional
points are recognised. (6.178)

That beings may be freed, this selflessness was taughtIn two ways, of phenomena and personal.And
to his followers our Teacher taught the sameBy classifying it in various different ways.
(6.179)

When emptiness is taught elaboratelyIt is of sixteen types, and when condensedIt is of four
types – this is the approachAdopted in the Greater Vehicle. (6.180)
