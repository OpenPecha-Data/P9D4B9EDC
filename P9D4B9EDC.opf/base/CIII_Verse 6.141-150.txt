Like he who finds that there’s a snake within his wall,Proclaiming it’s no elephant to ease
his frightAnd to escape the harm the serpent can inflict,Will surely end up being ridiculed
by all. (6.141)

The self is not within the aggregates,Nor are the aggregates found in the self.If they were
different that could be surmised.As they’re not different it’s but an idea. (6.142)

One cannot claim the self possesses form, becauseThere is no self, so ownership does not apply.One
owns a cow: distinct. One has a body: same.But form is not the same nor other than
the self. (6.143)

Form’s not the self, the self does not possess the form,There is no self in form, and form’s
not within self –All aggregates considered in this fourfold wayAnd added up amount to twenty
views of self. (6.144)

The vajra-wisdom seeing selflessness brings downThe mountains of the view of self, and when
that goesThe lofty peaks that rest upon this massive rangeOf viewing an identity are also
crushed. (6.145)

Some claim the person is substantial yet cannotBe labeled same or other, permanent or not,That
it’s an object of the six consciousnesses,And claim this is the basis for the sense of
self. (6.146)

To say, ‘mind is distinct from body,’ means it’s notIneffable – real things can’t be ineffable.If
self was proven to be real in any way,It would be real, like mind, and not ineffable.
(6.147)

Since, as you say, a pot is not real in itself –There’s nothing to point out apart from form
and such –Do not then think the self exists from its own sideWhen it’s ineffable except for
aggregates. (6.148)

You would agree that consciousness is not distinctFrom its own self, yet is a thing distinct
from form.As these two aspects may be seen in entities,No self exists; it lacks the features
of a thing. (6.149)

The basis of the sense of self is thus no thing,Not other than the aggregates, nor them themselves;It
isn’t their support, or else possessing them.And yet related to the aggregates it’s
there. (6.150)
