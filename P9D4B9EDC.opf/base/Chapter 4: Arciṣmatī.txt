The Fourth Ground: Radiant

Good qualities come in the wake of diligence;What brings one stores of merit and intelligence.As
this is where their diligence is burning strong,This ground, the fourth among them, is
the Radiant. (4.1)

There now appears for the sugata heirs a lightMore bright than copper, born from cultivation
ofThe thirty-seven factors of enlightenment â€“

And any sense of self is now entirely gone. (4.2)

Thus is the fourth resolve from Entering the Middle Way.
