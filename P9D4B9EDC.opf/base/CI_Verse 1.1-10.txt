From mighty sages hearers and half-buddhas come,While buddhas from the bodhisattvas are conceived.Compassion,
non-duality, awakening mind –These are what serve as causes of the victor’s
heirs. (1.1)

Since love is like the seed for the abundant cropOf victorhood, is like the water for its growth,Like
maturation for its yield to then endure,It’s therefore that I praise compassion
first of all. (1.2)

At first, the though of ‘I’ and clinging to a self;Then ‘This is mine’ as they become attached
to things.I bow to that compassion which sees every lifeAs powerless as buckets on a water-wheel.
(1.3)

Just like the moon reflected in a rippling pond,They see them waver, empty of inherent being.

The victor’s offspring filled with these compassionate thoughtsWill feel compelled to rescue
each and every one. (1.4)They dedicate just like Samantabhadra prayed,Established on the
Joyous which is called the first.

At present, signifying what they have attained,The epithet of bodhisattva is now theirs. (1.5)

They’ve taken birth as kin of the tathāgatas;Their fetters three have thus been utterly dispelled.These
bodhisattvas now endowed with utmost joyAre able to make hundred world systems
vibrate. (1.6)

As they’re progressing ever higher, ground to ground,The paths to lower states have now been
fully barred,All ordinary states of being brought to close,And they are now akin to the eighth
noble one. (1.7)

Though just the first taste of complete awakening,In strength of merit they now conquer and
surpassThe solitary buddhas and the Sage-speech born;

Unrivalled in their insight too on Far Advanced. (1.8)

To bring the realisation of full buddhahood,The first which now is stressed is generosity.

And when they even give their own flesh graciously,From that one may infer what cannot be perceived.
(1.9)

All beings long for only happiness,But people will not be content when poor.And seeing that
it is what fosters wealthThe Sage would first teach generosity. (1.10)
